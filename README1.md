## üß† Algorithm

This program demonstrates three sorting algorithms implemented using **pointers** in C++:

### 1. Bubble Sort
- Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- Repeats until the entire array is sorted.

### 2. Selection Sort
- Finds the minimum element in each iteration and places it at the beginning.
- Continues until the entire array is sorted.

### 3. Quick Sort
- Uses a divide-and-conquer approach.
- Selects a pivot and partitions the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot.
- Recursively applies the same logic to sub-arrays.

All algorithms use **pointer arithmetic** for accessing and manipulating elements.
