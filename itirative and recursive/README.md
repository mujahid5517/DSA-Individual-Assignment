## üß† Algorithm

This program demonstrates two methods of performing **Binary Search**:

### ‚úÖ Iterative Binary Search
- Uses a `while` loop to repeatedly divide the search space in half.
- Efficient for systems where recursion is costly or limited.

### ‚úÖ Recursive Binary Search
- Uses function calls to divide the problem and search the sub-array.
- Simple and elegant implementation.

### Steps:
1. Given a **sorted array** and a **target value**.
2. Compute the middle index.
3. If the middle element matches the target, return the index.
4. If the target is less than the middle, search in the left sub-array.
5. If greater, search in the right sub-array.
6. Repeat until the element is found or the search space is empty.
